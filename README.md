# SQL CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete

## 📘 Objective

The goal of this concept is to develop a solid understanding of **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations—core tasks used for managing data in a database using **SQL**. By mastering these operations, you'll be equipped to effectively manipulate data in relational databases.

---

## 📚 Concept Overview

### 🔑 Topics Covered

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**
- **CRUD Operations in SQL**

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between **Data Definition** and **Data Manipulation** languages in SQL.
- Learn how to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** data from a database.
- Practice CRUD operations using SQL commands.

---

## 🏗️ DDL (Data Definition Language)

**DDL statements** define and manage the structure of a database. Common commands include:

- `CREATE TABLE`: Create a new table.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Customers (
      CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Name VARCHAR(50),
      Email VARCHAR(100)
  );
  ```
**ALTER TABLE:** Modify an existing table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE Customers ADD Address VARCHAR(200);
```

**DROP TABLE:** Delete a table and its data.

```sql
DROP TABLE Customers;
```
**EXAMPLES**

```sql
  CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    EnrollmentDate DATE
);

```
## 🛠️ DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DML statements manipulate data within tables.

**INSERT:** Add new records.

```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (Name, Email)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
```
**UPDATE:** Modify existing records.

```sql
UPDATE Customers
SET Email = 'newemail@example.com'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```
**DELETE:** Remove records.

```sql
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```
---

Create a new table:

Create a new table called “Orders” with columns for OrderID (primary key), CustomerID (foreign key referencing the Students table), OrderDate, and Total.
Insert data into the Orders table:

Insert at least three new orders for different customers.
Read data from the Orders table:

Retrieve all orders placed on a specific date.
Retrieve orders for a specific customer, including the customer’s name and email from the Students table (using a JOIN).
Update data in the Orders table:

Update the Total column for a specific order.
Delete data from the Orders table:

Delete an order with a specific OrderID.

### Integrating Python with MySQL Databases

# MySQL Connector with Python – CRUD Operations

## Concept Overview

This project focuses on integrating Python with MySQL using the `mysql-connector-python` library to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It covers how to connect to a MySQL server, use cursors, and execute SQL queries directly from Python.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Introduction to `mysql-connector-python`
- Working with Cursors
- Executing SQL Queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- A Complete Example

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- ✅ Install and use the `mysql-connector-python` library
- ✅ Establish a connection to a MySQL database server
- ✅ Understand the concept of cursors in database interactions
- ✅ Execute basic SQL queries (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) using Python

---

## 🧩 Introduction to `mysql-connector-python`

`mysql-connector-python` is a popular library that bridges the gap between Python and MySQL databases. It provides a comprehensive interface for:

- Connecting to MySQL servers
- Executing SQL statements
- Managing data and database objects

It is an official MySQL product, ensuring reliability and compatibility.

---

## ⚙️ Installation

To install `mysql-connector-python`, use the following `pip` command:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```
---

## 🔗 Connecting to a MySQL Database

Once you have `mysql-connector-python` installed, you can start interacting with your MySQL server. Use the following code snippet to establish a connection:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Replace with your actual connection details
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(

    host="localhost",
    user="yourusername",
    password="yourpassword",
    database="yourdatabase"
)

print(mydb.get_server_info())
```

## Working with Cursors

Cursors are objects used to execute SQL statements and fetch results from your database. After establishing a connection, you can create a cursor like this:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Replace with your actual connection details
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="yourusername",
    password="yourpassword",
    database="yourdatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# Example: Execute an SQL command
# mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")

# Close the cursor and database connection when done
mycursor.close()
mydb.close()

```
# Syntax

# 📘 MySQL CRUD Syntax & Examples: `students` Table

This document provides SQL syntax and example queries for performing **CRUD operations** on a `students` table.

## 🗂️ Table Structure: `students`

| Column Name | Data Type                      | Constraints                    | Description                        |
|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|

| created_at  | TIMESTAMP                      | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP      | Record creation timestamp          |

---

## 🛠️ 1. CREATE TABLE

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other') NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
---
## 2. INSERT DATA

```mysql
INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, age, gender, email)
VALUES
('John', 'Doe', 21, 'Male', 'john.doe@example.com'),
('Jane', 'Smith', 19, 'Female', 'jane.smith@example.com'),
('Ali', 'Yusuf', 22, 'Male', 'ali.yusuf@example.com'),
('Liya', 'Amanuel', 18, 'Female', 'liya.amanuel@example.com'),
('Musa', 'Kemal', 25, 'Other', 'musa.kemal@example.com');
```
---
## 🔍 3. READ (SELECT) DATA

```mysql
SELECT * FROM students;
```
Select specific columns:

```mysql
SELECT first_name, age FROM students;
```
## ✏️ 4. UPDATE DATA
Update email where ID is 2:

```mysql
UPDATE students
SET email = 'new.email@example.com'
WHERE id = 2;
```
## ❌ 5. DELETE DATA
Delete student with ID 3:
```mysql
DELETE FROM students
WHERE id = 3;
```
